# Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification using Pre-Trained Models with Differential Attention Mechanism

This is a latest project focused on classifying Ovarian Cancer Subtypes using Deep Learning techniques! 
Ovarian Carcinoma is one of the most lethal cancers affecting women with various subtypes that require distinct treatment approaches
Ovarian cancer is a growth of cells that forms in the ovaries. The cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
The female reproductive system contains two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. The ovaries — each about the size of an almond — produce eggs (ova) as well as the hormones Estrogen and Progesterone.
Ovarian cancer treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy.

## Types of ovarian cancer
The type of cell where the cancer begins determines the type of ovarian cancer you have and helps your doctor determine which treatments are best for you. Ovarian cancer types include:
•	Epithelial ovarian cancer. This type is the most common. It includes several subtypes, including serous carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma.
•	Stromal tumors. These rare tumors are usually diagnosed at an earlier stage than other ovarian cancers.
•	Germ cell tumors. These rare ovarian cancers tend to occur at a younger age.

### How is ovarian cancer diagnosed?
Despite years of research, experts haven’t yet developed a successful ovarian cancer screening test. For this reason, the condition is often difficult to diagnose in the early stages.
If your healthcare provider suspects ovarian cancer, they’ll ask about your symptoms and perform a pelvic exam. During the exam, they’ll check for any abnormal growths or enlarged organs.
They may recommend additional tests, including:

Imaging tests
Providers may use several imaging tests, including:
•	Pelvic ultrasound.
•	MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
•	CT scan (computed tomography).
•	PET scan (positron emission tomography).
Blood tests
Blood tests look for a substance called CA-125. High levels of CA-125 in your blood can be a sign of cancer. However, CA-125 levels can be normal, even when cancer is present, and higher in many conditions that aren’t cancer. Because of this, providers use blood tests in combination with other tests to diagnose ovarian cancer.
Surgical evaluation
Providers can diagnose ovarian cancer during surgery. Typically, if they find abnormal growths, they’ll remove them during the same procedure.
Laparoscopy
During laparoscopic surgery, a surgeon places a thin camera (laparoscope) through a small cut (incision) made in your abdomen. Using the scope as a guide, along with additional ports to hold instruments, the surgeon can assess the cancer, perform staging biopsies and, in some circumstances, remove ovarian tumors.

## About Dataset: -
Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal cancer of the female reproductive system. There are five common subtypes of ovarian cancer: high-grade serous carcinoma, clear-cell ovarian carcinoma, endometrioid, low-grade serous, and mucinous carcinoma. Additionally, there are several rare subtypes ("Outliers"). These are all characterized by distinct cellular morphologies, etiologies, molecular and genetic profiles, and clinical attributes. Subtype-specific treatment approaches are gaining prominence, though first requires subtype identification, a process that could be improved with data science.
Dataset Contains 05 (Five) Subtypes of Ovarian Cancer, we have to create a deep learning model to classify cancer subtypes.

Subtypes of Ovarian Cancer:-
1) HGSC - High-Grade Serous Carcinoma
2) CC - Clear-Cell Ovarian Carcinoma
3) EC - Endometrioid
4) LGSC - Low-Grade Serous
5) MC - Mucinous Carcinoma
   
## Data Handling:- 
I utilized a comprehensive dataset comprising images of various Ovarian Cancer Subtypes.
Model Development: -
In this project I experimented with several state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures including Xception. MobileNet and InceptionV3 each augmented with Differential Attention Mechanism to improve feature extraction.

## Performance Evaluation:-
The models were evaluated on Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score metrics. Notably, the MobileNet model achieved an Accuracy = 81%, significantly improving subtype classification.

## Impact:-
This project not only strengthens the application of Deep Learning in Medical Diagnostics but also highlights the importance of precise classification in enhancing treatment strategies for Ovarian Cancer patients.
